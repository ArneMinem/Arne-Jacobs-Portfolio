# Battleships

First of all, here is a [link](https://youtu.be/8T9SbWaW6Js) to a demo of the game.

## Introduction

At school we had to program a game in Python in pairs. Romain JAUGEY and I decided to make a Battleship game.
Although our motivation did not end with a basic version of the game, we wanted to add some nice features to it.

In addition to making 3 difficulty levels, all based on other strategy algorithms, we also added a graphical interface to the game with kivy.
But, that was not enough for us! We wanted to link a database to our game that would store all the decisions made by humans playing the game.
This way, we could train some sort of machine learning algorithm to play the game.
This was the forth dificulty level that would become stronger the more people would play the game.
It would learn from the decisions made by the players and adapt its strategy to them.
Our final wish was to make a game mode where humans could play against each other.

## My work

I was mainly in charge of the two easy difficulty levels and the machine learning one.
Therefore, I had to create the strategies for the first two levels and the database for the last one.

Next to this, I also cleaned the code and made it more readable.

## Conclusion

This project was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about Python and how to program a game.
I also learned how to use a database and how to link it to a game.
I really loved the game so if you want to try it out, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/ArneMinem/BattleShips).
Simply clone the repository and run the main.py file.
Be careful, you need to have kivy installed on your computer to run the game.

I am really proud of the work we did and I am looking forward to working on other projects like this one.
