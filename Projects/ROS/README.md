# ROS2

You can find my repository for this project [here](https://github.com/ArneMinem/workspaceTdRos).

## Introduction

ROS2 was a class at school where we needed to learn how to use ROS2 to make a robot move in a 3D environment. The goal was to learn how to use ROS2 to interact with the simulation. In the final stage of the project there should have been 3 boats armed with turrets that would advance towards a certain target, circle around it while shooting at it. The turrets on the boats should have been able to rotate and shoot at the target all of the time.

## Work done

I completed the first and second parts of the project without to many big problems although it took a lot of time to make everything work. ROS2 is a very powerful tool but it is also very complex and it is hard to find the right information to make everything work. Through the naming of the topics and the nodes, the communication between the different parts of the project was becoming more complex as the project advanced.

The final part was about making the turrets turn to always point at their targets while the boats continued to move. I succeeded in making the boats track their targets and move towards them as you can see in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xerye8Xb8oQ). I also put the turrets on the boats but was unable to make these turrets turn towards their targets.

Here is the video of my only classmate who succeeded in making the turrets turn towards their targets: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJFJy68h31g).

If you want to see what I did for the first part of the project, you can find it [here](https://github.com/ArneMinem/workspaceTdRos/tree/main/src/td1). For the second and third part of the project, you can find it [here](https://github.com/ArneMinem/workspaceTdRos/tree/main/src/td2).

## Conclusion

Through this project I became a big fan of ROS2. It is a very powerful tool that can be used for a lot of different things. I am very happy that I had the opportunity to learn how to use it and I am sure that I will use it in the future for other projects.
