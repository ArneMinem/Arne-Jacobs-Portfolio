# SLAM

[Here](https://github.com/ArneMinem/Interval/tree/main) is the link to the repository of the project and [this](https://simon-rohou.fr/temp/codac/) to the course.

## Context

At school we had a course about `Interval Analysis` which we then used to implement a `Set-based Localization And Mapping` algorithm.

## My work

This was less of a project and more like individual homework but I present it here as a project because I learned a lot from it and I really love SLAM.

In order to achieve the SLAM algorithm, I had to understand constraint programming and implement this in C++.
I used the Codac library to compute the constraints and the intervals.
The Codac library was made by Simon Rohou, a researcher at ENSTA Bretagne.

Finally by following the steps of the course, I was able to implement the SLAM algorithm.
i had to go from the implementation of intervals and contractors to the implementation of a range-only SLAM algorithm crossing through static localization, making my own contractors and building tubes around the robot trajectory.

## What I learned

I learned a lot about constraint programming and how to implement it in C++. I also learned a lot about SLAM and how it works while mastering the Codac library.
