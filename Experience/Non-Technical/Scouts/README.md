# Scouts et Guides de France

From `August 2019` to `August 2023`

For those 4 years I was a scout leader at 4 Chateaux in Chaponnay (France)/

## 3 first years

During the first 3 years, I was a scout leader for the 11-14 years old.
There were generally around 30 children forming a mixed group and between 2 and 6 leaders.

During the year we organised day activities and weekend camps every 2 or 3 weekends.
On these activities I was generally accompanied by 2 or 3 other leaders.
During the year we would try to make 2 different imaginary worlds that would be the theme for each semester.
Our activities were generally based on the scout method and the scout law and turned around the themes of nature, respect, friendship, and autonomy.
All this while respecting the imaginary world we had created.

In the summer we would go on a 2-week camp with the children.
This camp was the highlight of the year and was the moment where we could really see the children grow and evolve.
During those camps I was always activity responsible and infirmaire.
Indeed, I was charged with organising the biggest activities and making sure that the children were safe and healthy.

## Last year

During the last year, I was a scout leader for the 14-17 years old.

That summer I was the camp chief for the 2-week camp.
I was in charge of the whole organisation of the camp.
I had to do all the paperwork prior to the camp and distribute the tasks to the other leaders.
It was a very big responsibility since there could be severe consequences if something went wrong.

But everything went well and the camp was a success.
Thus, I was able to finish my scout leader years with a great memory and a lot of experience.

Also, during that camp we had a volunteering project where we helped the local community renovating a castle and its surroundings.

## Conclusion

Being a scout leader was a great experience.
I learned a lot about leadership, teamwork, and how to manage a group of children.
I also learned a lot about how to organise activities and how to make sure that everything goes smoothly.

I also learned a lot about how to work under pressure and how to solve problems quickly.

I am very grateful for this experience and I am sure that it will help me in my future career.
Indeed, in order to be a good leader and camp chief I had to develop a lot of competencies that are very useful in the professional world.
For example, I had to develop my adaptability, creativity, autonomy, communication, organisation, time management, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
