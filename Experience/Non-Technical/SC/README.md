# 1 year in ENSTA Bretagne's student council

From `April 2023` to `April 2024`

## Student council

The student council is a group of students who are elected by their fellow peers to represent them in the decision-making process of the school. The student council takes on diverse responsibilities, such as organizing events, managing the budget, and addressing the concerns of the student body.

## My roles

### Integration responsible

During the year I had to organise activities and parties for new and old students to get to know each other. I had to manage a budget and make sure that the activities were inclusive and fun for everyone.
I needed to make sure that all students lived in a good atmosphere and that they felt welcome in the school.
That none of the students felt left out or alone.
That the activities were varied and that everyone could find something they liked.

Thus during the year I organised, together with other integration responsibles and other people from the student council, the following events:
- Parties once every week
- Cinema nights in Brest's theaters
- Trips to the beach
- Art workshops
- Sports tournaments

From end of August to end of September, we planned a whole integration month with the whole student council. 
The goal was to make sure that all students felt welcome and that they could make friends easily while partying all day to celebrate the beginning of the school year and mostly the end of their 2 years of preparatory classes during which almost none of them had a social life.
During this month we organised:
- Multiple parties at school with different themes
- Trips to the beach with games and barbecues and surfing lessons
- A dorms, city and pub crawl to make sure that everyone knew where everything was and that they could make friends easily
- A sports tournament with multiple sports
- A movie night in the school's amphitheater
- A military training day with some students with a military background
- Game nights
- Art workshops
- Wakeboarding
- Laser game
- aso

The main event of those 4 weeks was the integration weekend where we rented a whole camping site for the students to party and get to know each other even more. We had a lot of activities planned such as:
- Big parties with our own DJs
- Waterfun in the camping site's pool and slides
- A moussing party
- Some big games in which students sorted in different teams had to compete against each other
- aso

### Security responsible

On top of my integration responsibilities, I also served as one of the security responsibles for the student council. My main focus was ensuring the safety of all attendees at our events and preventing any harm. I was responsible for enforcing the school's rules and regulations, particularly regarding alcohol consumption. After each party, it was my duty to ensure that everyone made it home safely and that no one was left behind. Together with the other security responsibles, we guided students back to the dorms during and after every event. Additionally, we organized security training sessions conducted by a professional to further enhance the safety awareness of the students.

## Personal development

During my time in the student council, I had the opportunity to enhance my leadership skills and collaborate effectively within a team. I gained valuable experience in managing budgets and organizing events. Moreover, I improved my communication skills by addressing the concerns of my peers. This experience was truly fulfilling and contributed to my personal growth. I am grateful for the chance to have been part of the student council and make a positive impact on the school community. I highly recommend this experience to those looking to develop their leadership abilities and create a meaningful difference in their school. 

More specifically, I learned how to:
- Manage a budget
- Organize events
- Communicate effectively
- Work in a team
- Lead a team
- Address concerns
- Make sure that everyone feels welcome and included
- Make sure that everyone is safe
