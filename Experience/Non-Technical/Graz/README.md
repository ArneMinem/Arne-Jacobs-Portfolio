The course was about Data Science and lasted for 11 days in Graz, Austria. It was attended by 22 students from 17 different nationalities across Europe. During the course, participants attended classes on Data Science and worked on group projects. They also visited a research lab in Graz focused on Data Science.

My responsibilities included ensuring the well-being of the participants and making sure they followed the course rules.

It was also a unique opportunity to develop my leadership skills and ensure the participants' enjoyment of the course. Additionally, I gained insights into working collaboratively as a team and utilizing various tools in the field of Data Science.
