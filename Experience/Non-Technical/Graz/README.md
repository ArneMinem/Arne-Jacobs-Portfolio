# Co-organiser of BEST course in Graz

From the `4th` to the `15th of February 2024`

## BEST

BEST (Board of European Students of Technology) is a European student organization that organizes events for students from all over Europe. The events are organized by local groups in different European cities. The events can be courses, seminars, or leisure events.

## Course

The course was about Data Science and lasted for 11 days in Graz, Austria. The course was attended by 22 students from all over Europe.
During the course participants had to follow some classes about Data Science and work on a project in groups of 4 or 5 students.
They also visited a research lab in Graz that works on Data Science.

## My role

I was part of the organising team of the course and my role was Pax Responsible. This means that I was responsible for the well-being of the participants. I had to make sure that they were feeling good and that they were enjoying the course. I also had to make sure that they were respecting the rules of the course.

Part of my role was to be with the participants during the day and to make sure that they were following the schedule.
