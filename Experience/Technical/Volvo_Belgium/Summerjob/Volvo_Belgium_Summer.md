# 3 weeks of student work at Volvo Belgium

`31st of July to the 18th of august 2023`

## About the team

I worked at Volvo Cars Ghent in the body shop.
It was mainly during the summer shutdown, so there were not a lot of people around.
Thus, I was placed wherever they needed me.

## My tasks

### 1. Maintenance of the doorfixtures' overhead conveyors

We spend a week mesuring the thickness of the conveyors to analyze the wear and tear.
The mesuring was done with an ultrasonic thickness gauge.
We had to put some couplant on the conveyor to get a good reading.

Thanks to this task I had a good understanding of how the conveyors work and how they are maintained.
But also how to use an ultrasonic thickness gauge and how to interpret the results.
Finally, this gave me an even better overview of the body shop from a different angle.

### 2. Storage inventory and organization

The first team needed someone to sort out their storage room and make an inventory of the parts.
There was also another team that had a maintenance equipment cupboard that needed to be sorted out.
I also had to check the names giving to said devices and make sure that the devices worked.

Doing this task I earned a lot of practical knowledge about the parts that are used in the body shop and the devices that are used to maintain them.
I also learned how the company names their devices and how they keep track of them.
Finally, I learned how to organize a storage room and how to make an inventory of the parts.

### 3. Surveillance of a particular workstation

The third week, the production restarted and I was placed at a workstation that had a lot of breakdowns.
Once in a while a car would not get detected by the proximity sensors and the whole line would stop.
In these cases, I had to get inside the workstation and pull the car mannually to the induction sensor.
Once this was done, I had to restart the line and make sure that the car was detected.

During the hours where the problem did not occur I tried to find the source of the problem.
At the end of the week, we found out that the station had been modified during the summer break and that the modified code was based on an older version of the code.
Thus, the part that was supposed to make sure that the car reached the sensor was not there anymore.

The code was adapted and since then the problem has not occurred anymore.

## What I learned

Throughout the 3 weeks I did some very different tasks that added up to my previous experience at Volvo Cars Ghent.
Now I have a wider view of all the maintenance teams and how they work.

## Conclusion

This student work was a great experience for me.

It developped further my problem-solving and adaptability competencies.
I also learned a lot about preventive maintenance and how to organize a storage room.
