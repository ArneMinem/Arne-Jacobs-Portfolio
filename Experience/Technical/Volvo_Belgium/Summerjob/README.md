# 3 weeks of student work at Volvo Belgium
`31st of July to the 18th of august 2023`

## About the team

I had the opportunity to work at Volvo Cars Ghent in the body shop during the summer shutdown. Despite the reduced number of people, I was able to contribute wherever I was needed.

## My tasks

### 1. Maintenance of the doorfixtures' overhead conveyors

During this task, we spent a week measuring the thickness of the conveyors to assess their wear and tear. We used an ultrasonic thickness gauge and applied couplant on the conveyor to ensure accurate readings. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of conveyor systems, maintenance practices, and the interpretation of ultrasonic thickness gauge results. It also allowed me to gain a different perspective on the body shop operations.

### 2. Storage inventory and organization

I was assigned to sort out the storage room and create an inventory of parts for one team. Additionally, I helped organize a maintenance equipment cupboard for another team. As part of this task, I verified the names of devices and ensured their functionality. Through this assignment, I acquired practical knowledge about the parts used in the body shop, device naming conventions, and inventory management techniques.

### 3. Surveillance of a particular workstation

During the third week, I was assigned to a workstation that frequently experienced breakdowns. My role was to manually assist in detecting cars that were not being picked up by the proximity sensors, which caused the entire production line to halt. I would manually move the car to the induction sensor and restart the line to ensure proper detection. In my spare time, I investigated the root cause of the issue. Eventually, we discovered that the station had been modified during the summer break, resulting in a missing component that was crucial for car detection. We rectified the code, and the problem has not recurred since then.

## What I learned

Throughout the three weeks, I had the opportunity to engage in diverse tasks that complemented my previous experience at Volvo Cars Ghent. This experience provided me with a broader understanding of the various maintenance teams and their operations.

## Conclusion

My time as a student worker at Volvo Cars Ghent was a valuable and enriching experience. It allowed me to further develop my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and knowledge of preventive maintenance practices. Additionally, I gained insights into storage room organization and inventory management techniques.
