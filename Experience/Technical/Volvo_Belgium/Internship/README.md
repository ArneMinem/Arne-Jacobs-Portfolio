# 1 month at Volvo Cars Ghent as intern in the body shop with the breakdown technicians

`2nd to the 27th of January 2023`

## About the team

I was part of a team of breakdown technicians working in the body shop.
We were the B shift of the 4th zone of the body shop, responsible for the maintenance and repair of breakdowns in the final assembly lines. 

## My role

Since this was more of a learning experience than a working one, I was not given any specific tasks. Instead, I was able to follow the breakdown technicians around and learn from them.
I helped them whenever I could, and I was able to get a good understanding of the work they do.
When ther were no breakdowns, I was able to help with the maintenance of the tools and the workstations.
I did spend some hours repairing buttons on the workstations, which was a nice change of pace.
These repairs mostly consisted of soldering the buttons back to the wires that had come loose.
Finally, I changed a lot of resistors on the workstations that had burnt out.

## What I learned

Throughout the month, I learned a lot about the body shop, Volvo Cars and how big companies work.
I learned how to solder and how to change resistors as mentionned above.
But I also learned a lot about PLCs and how they are used in the body shop.
I learned how to read the PLCs and how to understand the error messages that they give.
I also learned about welding, hydrlic presses and tube replacement, 1D and 2D lasers, inductive sensors, aso.
I also did a complete, 11 km long, tour of the plant on my own to see how the body goes from empty shell to finished car.

## Conclusion

This internship was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about the body shop and how it works.
I also learned a lot about the work of a breakdown technician and how they work.

I gain a lot of practical knowledge that I will be able to use in the future.

My skillset also improved a lot, especially the technical skillset.

Finally, I learned a lot about how big companies work and how they are organized while developing my communication, teamwork, problem-solving and adaptability competencies.
