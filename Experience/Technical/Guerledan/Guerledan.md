# 2 weeks at Guerledan lake

Automated robotics students at ENSTA Bretagne have the opportunity to spend two weeks per at Guerledan lake.
In our M1 year, we need to progam a boat to succeed daily challenges given to us by our professors.

We went to the lake in [September 2023](https://github.com/ArneMinem/Guerledan_S3) and [February 2024](https://github.com/ArneMinem/Guerledan_S4). The challenges were different each time, and we had to adapt our boat to the new conditions.

PS: The repositories are in French but it should be easy to translate the READMEs in your browser.

## The team

For these two weeks at Guerledan, I was accompanied by: Léa RION and Laura JOUVET.

There were also other teams with us, and we all had to compete against each other.

Although we were in different teams, we all helped each other out when needed.

Most of our professors were also present at the lake. They were there to help us and to give us new challenges.

## The boat

The challenges had to be done with a DDBoat.
A DDBoat is a small boat with two propellers programmable in Python.
We would program on our computers and then send the code to the boat via a Wi-Fi connection.

The boat was equipped with a GPS, a compass and an IMU.

## The challenges

Both weeks started with the calibration of the boat.
We had to make sure that the boat was going straight and that the compass was correctly calibrated.

Otherwise, during those two weeks we had to do several challenges that you can read about in the repositories linked above.

## My work

### First week

I mainly worked on the calibration of the boat for the first day.
After that, I did a big job for the waypoint tracking challenge.
At the end, we encountered some problems, thus while my teammates tried fixing them, I started modifying our codes to log the important data of each test.

With these logs we could analyze the data and see what went wrong.

### Second week

The first and second day I worked together with Laura on keeping a defined course.
After that, I worked again on the logging because this week we needed to log even more data.
Then on the third day, I helped Léa with the challenge of contourning a buoy by following a virtual point in a vector field.
When we succeeded in doing this challenge, we had to do a consensus challenge.
Thus, I sat together with Romain BORNIER - a classmate from another team - to make a consensus algorithm between our two boats.
We made some simulations with python and those worked but we did not succeed in doing the challenge on the lake before the end of the week.

Next to the programming part, I also helped with the mechanical part of the boat.
Indeed, we had a lot of problems with our boats so we had to change boats a couple of times.
Next to that, we also had to change the propellers two times and straighten the propeller shafts because they were bent, implying that the boat would not go straight.

## Conclusion

These two weeks were amazing in multiple ways.
First of all, we had the opportunity to work with a real boat and to see how our code would work in real life.
Basically, we could try out everything we learned during the year.

Next to this, we also had the opportunity to work in a team.
We had to communicate a lot to make sure that everyone knew what they had to do.
We really had because our professors loved giving us hard challenges to keep us fully occupied during the two weeks.

Finally, the nice thing about these two weeks is that we could see the progress we made.
The first week is only a couple of weeks after we started our studies in automated robotics so we did not know a lot.
But the second week we already knew a lot more and we noticed that we could do a lot more than the first week.
Everything that we already saw in the first week came back in the second week, but we could do it a lot faster and better, leaving us with more time to do the new challenges.

During those weeks, I mainly developed my programming skills in Python and my skills in working in a team.
Since there always were a lot of problems with the programs, I also learned how to debug code and how to log data to analyze it later.
Keeping my calm and focus was also a big part of these two weeks because we had to work under a lot of pressure.
