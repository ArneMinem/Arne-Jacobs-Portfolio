# 2 weeks at Guerledan lake

At ENSTA Bretagne, students in the automated robotics program have the unique opportunity to spend two weeks at Guerledan lake. During our M1 year, we are tasked with programming a boat to overcome daily challenges assigned by our professors.

We visited the lake in [September 2023](https://github.com/ArneMinem/Guerledan_S3) and [February 2024](https://github.com/ArneMinem/Guerledan_S4). Each visit presented different challenges, requiring us to adapt our boat to the new conditions.

## The Team

During our time at Guerledan, I was accompanied by Léa RION and Laura JOUVET. Other teams were also present, and although we were competing against each other, we provided assistance whenever needed.

Most of our professors were present at the lake as well. They were there to support us and present us with new challenges.

## The Boat

The challenges were completed using a DDBoat, a small boat equipped with two programmable Python propellers. We would write the code on our computers and then send it to the boat via a Wi-Fi connection.

The boat was equipped with a GPS, compass, and IMU.

## The Challenges

Both weeks began with calibrating the boat, ensuring it traveled straight and the compass was properly calibrated.

Throughout the two weeks, we tackled various challenges, which can be found in the linked repositories above.

## My Work

### First Week

During the first day, I focused on calibrating the boat. Afterward, I played a significant role in the waypoint tracking challenge. Towards the end, we encountered some issues, so while my teammates worked on resolving them, I modified our code to log important data from each test.

These logs allowed us to analyze the data and identify any issues.

### Second Week

During the first and second day, I collaborated with Laura to maintain a defined course. Following that, I continued working on logging, as we needed to capture even more data this week. On the third day, I assisted Léa with the challenge of contouring a buoy by following a virtual point in a vector field.

Once we successfully completed this challenge, we faced a consensus challenge. To tackle it, I worked with Romain BORNIER, a classmate from another team, to develop a consensus algorithm between our two boats. While our Python simulations were successful, we were unable to complete the challenge on the lake before the week ended.

In addition to programming, I also contributed to the mechanical aspects of the boat. We encountered numerous problems, resulting in multiple boat changes. We also had to replace the propellers twice and straighten the propeller shafts, as they were bent, causing the boat to veer off course.

## Conclusion

These two weeks were truly remarkable in several ways. Firstly, we had the opportunity to work with a real boat and witness how our code performed in real-life scenarios. Essentially, we were able to apply everything we had learned throughout the year.

Furthermore, we experienced the dynamics of teamwork. Effective communication was crucial to ensure everyone knew their responsibilities. Our professors delighted in presenting us with challenging tasks, keeping us fully engaged throughout the two weeks.

Lastly, these two weeks allowed us to witness our progress. During the first week, shortly after starting our studies in automated robotics, we had limited knowledge. However, by the second week, we had acquired a wealth of knowledge and noticed significant improvement. We were able to complete tasks from the first week more efficiently, leaving us with more time to tackle new challenges.

During this period, I honed my programming skills in Python and developed my ability to work effectively in a team. Given the frequent program issues, I also gained expertise in debugging code and logging data for later analysis. Maintaining composure and focus were essential, as we worked under significant pressure.
