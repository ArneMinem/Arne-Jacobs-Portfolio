# 3 months at Volvo Cars Torlsanda as an intern in robotics and automation engineering

`6th of May 2024 to the 26th of July 2024`

## About the team

I was part of a team of manufacturing technology developers working for Strategy & innovation.
I got my tasks from the robotics and automation expert.

## My tasks

### I. Guideline for FANUC robots safety configuration

I wrote a guideline for the safety configuration of FANUC robots. This guideline was meant for the line builders that would install the robots on the production line.
Before I wrote the guideline, I had to understand the safety requirements for the robots and the production line. I also had to understand the safety configuration of the robots.
FANUC robots use RoboGuide both for simulation and for programming. I had to understand how to configure the safety settings in RoboGuide.
Since nobody At Volvo Cars had experience with the safety configuration of FANUC robots, I had to learn everything from scratch.
Even worse, since FANUC was Volvo Cars new supplier for robots, nobody had experience with FANUC robots at all.
Those that have tried out RoboGuide will know that it is not the most user-friendly software. It took me a while to understand how to configure the safety settings.
After nearly 7 weeks of work, I had a guideline that was ready to be used by the line builders.

When the guideline was ready, I had to present it to the robotics and automation expert. He was very satisfied with the work I had done.
We spent some time together going through the guideline so that I could explain him everything he needed to know for when he would present it to the line builders.

### II. Cobot research and documentation

I had to research cobots and write multiple documents about them.

#### Cobot specification matrix

I had to write a document that compared the specifications of different cobots from different manufacturers. I studied all the cobots from FANUC, ABB, Universal Robots, KUKA, Flexiv, Han's Robots, and Neura Robotics.

This document was meant to be used by the robotics and automation expert to help him choose the right cobot for the right task but more importantly, to help him understand the capabilities of the cobots and to decide with which manufacturer Volvo Cars should work with.

Here you have the Matrix I made:

#### Cobot supplier analysis

I also made a document that analyzed the different cobot suppliers. I gave quick presentations of the different suppliers and their cobots and a summ-up of their strengths and weaknesses.
This document was meant to give a global view of each supplier and not only their cobots.
Indeed, the supplier is as important as the cobot itself. The supplier has to be able to provide the right support and the right service.
Thus, their location, their support, their service, their price, their size and their reputation were all taken into account.

#### Cobot case distinguisher

I made a document that explained how to distinguish which cells in the plants could use cobots and which cells could not.
This document was meant to be used by the operators and other employees in the plants to help them understand when they could use cobots and when they could not.
With this document they could look at a cell and decide if it was a good candidate for a cobot or not.
The document made them first look at the cell and then answer a series of questions about what a cobot in said cell would bring to the production line. Would Does it improve the ergonomics? Would it avoid overtime in critical stations? Would it improve safety? Would it improve quality? Would it provide a decent Return On Investment?
If most of these questions were answered with a yes, then they had to think about the possibilty of a cobot in terms of space and mainly in terms of the task that the cobot would have to do.
Finally, there was a score matrix that would go deeper into the details of the task and give a score to the cell. If the score was high enough, then the cell was a good candidate for a cobot.
This final part was mainly made in correspondance with ABB's and FANUC's cobots since those were the current suppliers of Volvo Cars.

#### Needs for a cobot in the plant

The final document was one for the suppliers in which I explained what Volvo Cars needed from a cobot. This document was meant to be sent to the suppliers so that they could understand what Volvo Cars needed from a cobot.
It was accompanied with a form that the suppliers had to fill in so that Volvo Cars could compare the different suppliers and their cobots.
With this document Volvo Cars could make a decision on which supplier to work with.

### III. Cobot presentation to the high management

I had to present the cobots to the high management of Volvo Cars. I had to explain them what cobots were and what they could bring to the production line.

I made a presentation that explained the basics of cobots and where Volvo Cars was in terms of cobots. It also presented what the future could and should look like in the plants.
After the presentation I did a demonstration of a cobot that I had programmed to do a simple task. The cobot was a GoFa from ABB and the task was to pick up some parts and place them in the right position at the right location.
After this demonstration, I showed them how easy it is to program a cobot and how easy it is to change the task of a cobot.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot about robotics and automation during my time at Volvo Cars. I learned how to configure the safety settings of a FANUC robot, how to program a cobot, how to choose a cobot, how to choose a cobot supplier, how to present a cobot to the high management, and how to write documents about cobots.

I also learned how to work in a big company and how to work in a team. I learned how to communicate with people from different departments and how to communicate with people from different countries.

I am very grateful for the opportunity that Volvo Cars gave me and I hope to work with them again in the future.

During this time I gain knowledge in the following areas:
- Cobots and industrial robots
- Safety measures for industrial robots and cobots
- RoboGuide

My skills in the following areas were improved:
- Simulation and programming of industrial robots and cobots
- Making detailled and clear guidelines and documentation
- Presentation of complex subjects to people with no knowledge in the subject

Finally, in terms of competencies, I improved in:
- Problem solving
- Communication
- Teamwork
- Time management
- Adaptability
- Initiative
- Strategic planning

Here is the feedback I got from my supervisor at Volvo Cars:

"*Arne Jacobs has been an outstanding student, contributing significantly to our 81012 Technology Development departement. He has primarily focused on robotic tasks, espacially with cobots and FANUC Robotics.*

*Arne has demonstrated the ability to work independently with minimal supervision. He quickly grasps the tasks assigned to him and shows a deep understanding of the challenges involved, consistently developing effective solutions.*

*Arne is highly regarded by his colleagues here at Volvo Cars.*"
