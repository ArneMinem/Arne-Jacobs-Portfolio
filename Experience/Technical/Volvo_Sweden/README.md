# 3 months at Volvo Cars Torlsanda as an intern in robotics and automation engineering
`6th of May 2024 to the 26th of July 2024`

## About the team

I was part of a team of manufacturing technology developers working for Strategy & innovation.
I received my tasks from the robotics and automation expert.

## My tasks

### I. Guideline for FANUC robots safety configuration

I created a guideline for the safety configuration of FANUC robots. This guideline was intended for the line builders responsible for installing the robots on the production line.
Before writing the guideline, I had to understand the safety requirements for the robots and the production line. I also had to familiarize myself with the safety configuration of the robots.
FANUC robots use RoboGuide for both simulation and programming. I had to learn how to configure the safety settings in RoboGuide.
Since no one at Volvo Cars had experience with the safety configuration of FANUC robots, I had to start from scratch.
Furthermore, since FANUC was a new supplier for Volvo Cars, no one had any experience with FANUC robots at all.
Those who have used RoboGuide know that it is not the most user-friendly software. It took me some time to understand how to configure the safety settings.
After nearly 7 weeks of work, I had a guideline ready to be used by the line builders.

Once the guideline was ready, I had to present it to the robotics and automation expert. He was very satisfied with the work I had done.
We spent some time together going through the guideline so that I could explain everything he needed to know when presenting it to the line builders.

### II. Cobot research and documentation

I conducted research on cobots and wrote multiple documents about them.

#### Cobot specification matrix

I created a document that compared the specifications of different cobots from various manufacturers. I studied cobots from FANUC, ABB, Universal Robots, KUKA, Flexiv, Han's Robots, and Neura Robotics.

This document was intended to assist the robotics and automation expert in selecting the appropriate cobot for each task. It also helped in understanding the capabilities of the cobots and deciding which manufacturer Volvo Cars should work with.

Here is the matrix I created:

#### Cobot supplier analysis

I also prepared a document analyzing different cobot suppliers. I provided brief presentations of the suppliers and their cobots, along with a summary of their strengths and weaknesses.
This document aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of each supplier, not just their cobots.
The supplier's location, support, service, price, size, and reputation were all taken into account.

#### Cobot case distinguisher

I created a document explaining how to determine which cells in the plants could utilize cobots and which cells could not.
This document was intended for operators and other employees in the plants to help them understand when cobots could be used and when they could not.
The document guided them to assess a cell and answer a series of questions about the benefits a cobot would bring to the production line. Would it improve ergonomics? Would it reduce overtime in critical stations? Would it enhance safety? Would it improve quality? Would it provide a decent return on investment?
If most of these questions were answered with a yes, they had to consider the feasibility of a cobot in terms of space and primarily the task the cobot would perform.
Finally, there was a score matrix that delved into the task details and assigned a score to the cell. If the score was high enough, the cell was deemed a good candidate for a cobot.
This final part was mainly developed in collaboration with ABB's and FANUC's cobots, as they were the current suppliers for Volvo Cars.

#### Needs for a cobot in the plant

The final document was intended for the suppliers, explaining what Volvo Cars required from a cobot. This document was sent to the suppliers to help them understand Volvo Cars' needs.
It was accompanied by a form that the suppliers had to fill in, allowing Volvo Cars to compare the different suppliers and their cobots.
With this document, Volvo Cars could make an informed decision on which supplier to work with.

### III. Cobot presentation to the high management

I had to present the concept of cobots to the high management of Volvo Cars. I explained what cobots were and how they could benefit the production line.

I created a presentation that covered the basics of cobots and Volvo Cars' current position in terms of cobots. It also outlined the future prospects and expectations in the plants.
After the presentation, I conducted a demonstration of a cobot that I had programmed to perform a simple task. The cobot was a GoFa from ABB, and the task was to pick up parts and place them in the correct position at the designated location.
Following the demonstration, I showcased how easy it is to program a cobot and modify its tasks.

## Conclusion

During my time at Volvo Cars, I gained extensive knowledge in robotics and automation. I learned how to configure the safety settings of FANUC robots, program cobots, select cobots and cobot suppliers, present cobots to high management, and create documentation about cobots.

I also developed skills in working within a large company and collaborating with diverse teams. I learned how to effectively communicate with individuals from different departments and countries.

I am grateful for the opportunity Volvo Cars provided me, and I look forward to potential future collaborations.

Throughout this experience, I acquired knowledge in the following areas:
- Cobots and industrial robots
- Safety measures for industrial robots and cobots
- RoboGuide

I improved my skills in the following areas:
- Simulating and programming industrial robots and cobots
- Creating detailed and clear guidelines and documentation
- Presenting complex subjects to individuals with no prior knowledge

Lastly, in terms of competencies, I enhanced the following:
- Problem-solving
- Communication
- Teamwork
- Time management
- Adaptability
- Initiative
- Strategic planning

Here is the feedback I received from my supervisor at Volvo Cars:

"*Arne Jacobs has been an exceptional student, making significant contributions to our 81012 Technology Development department. He primarily focused on robotic tasks, particularly with cobots and FANUC Robotics.*

*Arne has demonstrated the ability to work independently with minimal supervision. He quickly grasps assigned tasks and exhibits a deep understanding of the associated challenges, consistently developing effective solutions.*

*Arne is highly respected by his colleagues here at Volvo Cars.*"
