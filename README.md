# Arne Jacobs' Portfolio

## About

This is my portfolio, where I showcase my projects and skills. I am a student at ENSTA Bretagne, a French engineering school, and I am currently studying automation and robotics. I am passionate about programming, and I am always looking for new projects to work on.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Autonomous Drone](

This project is about developing an autonomous drone that can navigate through a forest. The drone is equipped with a camera and a LIDAR sensor, and it uses SLAM algorithms to build a map of the environment and plan its path.

### [Project 2: Robot Arm Control](

This project is about controlling a robot arm using inverse kinematics. The robot arm has 6 degrees of freedom, and it is controlled using a Python script that calculates the joint angles based on the desired end-effector position.

### [Project 3: Computer Vision App](

This project is about developing a computer vision app that can detect objects in images. The app uses a pre-trained neural network to classify objects in real-time, and it displays the results on the screen.
