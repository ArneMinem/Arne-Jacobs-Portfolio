## STIBO de Speurneus

STIBO de Speurneus is an afterschool care center during the school year and a holiday camp during the summer. It offers care for children aged 3-6 and 6-12.

## Responsibilities

As an animator at STIBO de Speurneus, my main responsibility was to ensure the well-being and enjoyment of the 6-12 year olds. This involved planning and organizing various activities, ensuring their safety, and monitoring their food and drink intake.

To create a positive environment, I engaged with the children through play, crafts, and games. This approach allowed me to build rapport with them and address any issues that arose.

## Personal Development

Working at STIBO de Speurneus provided an opportunity to enhance my social skills. Effective communication with children, parents, and colleagues was crucial. Problem-solving, creativity, and adaptability were also key skills developed through daily interactions with the children and their needs.

Additionally, collaborating with a team was essential for a successful experience.
