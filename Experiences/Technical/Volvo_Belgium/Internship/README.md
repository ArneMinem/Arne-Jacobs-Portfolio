# 1 month at Volvo Cars Ghent as intern in the body shop with the breakdown technicians
`2nd to the 27th of January 2023`

## About the team

I was part of a team of breakdown technicians working in the body shop.
We were the B shift of the 4th zone of the body shop, responsible for the maintenance and repair of breakdowns in the final assembly lines. 

## My role

Since this was more of a learning experience than a working one, I observed and learned from the breakdown technicians.
I assisted them whenever possible and gained a good understanding of their work.
During periods without breakdowns, I helped with tool and workstation maintenance.
I also repaired buttons on the workstations, involving soldering buttons back to loose wires.
Additionally, I replaced burnt-out resistors on the workstations.

## What I learned

Throughout the month, I gained knowledge about the body shop, Volvo Cars, and the operations of large companies.
I learned soldering and resistor replacement techniques, as mentioned earlier.
I also learned about PLCs and how they are utilized in the body shop.
I acquired the ability to read PLCs and interpret error messages.
Furthermore, I learned about welding, hydraulic presses, tube replacement, 1D and 2D lasers, and inductive sensors.
I independently toured the plant, covering a distance of 11 km, to observe the body's transformation into a finished car.

## Conclusion

This internship provided me with a valuable experience in the body shop and its operations.
I gained insights into the work of breakdown technicians and their processes.
I acquired practical knowledge that will be beneficial in the future.
My technical skills improved significantly.
Moreover, I gained an understanding of the organizational structure and functioning of large companies, while enhancing my communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability skills.
